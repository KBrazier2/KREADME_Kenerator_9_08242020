## Description

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer Package.


## Installation

Run node index.js in the command line. The user will be presented with several questions for inputting necessary elements towards the README file. Once all elements have been properly inputted, a README file will be generated.
